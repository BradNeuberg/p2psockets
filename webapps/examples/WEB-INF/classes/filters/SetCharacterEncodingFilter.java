/**
 * <p>Example filter that sets the character encoding to be used in parsing the
 * incoming request, either unconditionally or only if the client did not
 * specify a character encoding.  Configuration of this filter is based on
 * the following initialization parameters:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>encoding</strong> - The character encoding to be configured
 *     for this request, either conditionally or unconditionally based on
 *     the <code>ignore</code> initialization parameter.  This parameter
 *     is required, so there is no default.</li>
 * <li><strong>ignore</strong> - If set to "true", any character encoding
 *     specified by the client is ignored, and the value returned by the
 *     <code>selectEncoding()</code> method is set.  If set to "false,
 *     <code>selectEncoding()</code> is called <strong>only</strong> if the
 *     client has not already specified an encoding.  By default, this
 *     parameter is set to "true".</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Although this filter can be used unchanged, it is also easy to
 * subclass it and make the <code>selectEncoding()</code> method more
 * intelligent about what encoding to choose, based on characteristics of
 * the incoming request (such as the values of the <code>Accept-Language</code>
 * and <code>User-Agent</code> headers, or a value stashed in the current
 * user's session.</p>

<p>P2P Sockets makes it easy to
write peer-to-peer applications based
on JXTA. P2P Sockets allows programmers to gain much of the power of
JXTA, such as NAT and firewall traversal, without
being exposed to its complexity. It does this through ports of popular
software projects, such as a web server and web services stack,
to work on the <a href="http://www.jxta.org">JXTA</a>
peer-to-peer
network. This includes a web server (Jetty) that can receive requests
and serve content over the peer-to-peer network; a servlet and JSP
engine (Jetty and Jasper) that allows existing servlets and JSPs to
serve P2P clients; an XML-RPC client and server (Apache XML-RPC) for
accessing and exposing P2P XML-RPC endpoints; an HTTP/1.1 client
(Apache Commons HTTP-Client)
that can access P2P web servers; a gateway (Smart Cache) to make it
possible for existing browsers to access P2P web sites; and a <a
 href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWiki">WikiWiki</a>
(JSPWiki)
that can be used to host WikiWikis on your local machine that other
peers can access and edit through the P2P network. P2P Sockets also
introduces implementations of java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket
that can work on the JXTA
network as well as a simple, light-weight, distributed, human-friendly,
and non-secure DNS system. For example,
to have a peer expose a simple service that can be reached by other
peers, you would use the following code:</p>
<pre><code><br>// create a service with the name "www.nike.laborpolicy" on virtual port 100<br>java.net.ServerSocket server = new P2PServerSocket("www.nike.laborpolicy", 100); // port 100<br>// wait for a client to connect<br>java.net.Socket client = server.accept();<br>// client accepted; now communicate<br>InputStream in = client.getInputStream();<br>OutputStream out = client.getOutputStream();<br>// do application specific work now<br></code></pre>
<br>
The client side is just as simple:
<br>
<pre><code><br>// connect to a peer offering the service at "www.nike.laborpolicy" on virtual port 100<br>java.net.Socket socket = new P2PSocket("www.nike.laborpolicy", 100);<br>// now start communicating<br>InputStream in = socket.getInputStream();<br>OutputStream out = socket.getOutputStream();<br></code></pre>
<p>Peers can now host and consume
services even if they are normally
unreachable, such as if they are behind NAT
or firewalls, and can publish services to P2P Socket's lightweight
distributed domain name system without having
to configure or deploy customized DNS servers.</p>

If you answered yes to any of the above, then welcome to the
Peer-to-Peer Sockets project! The Peer-to-Peer Sockets Project
reimplements Java's standard Socket, ServerSocket, and InetAddress
classes to work on a peer-to-peer network rather than on the standard
TCP/IP network. "Aren't standard TCP/IP sockets and server sockets
already peer-to-peer?" some might ask. Standard TCP/IP sockets and
server sockets are theoretically peer-to-peer but in practice are not
due to firewalls, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, and
political and technical issues with the Domain Name System (DNS). <br>
<br>
The P2P Sockets project deals with these issues by re-implementing the
standard java.net classes on top of the <a href="http://www.jxta.org">Jxta</a>
peer-to-peer network. Jxta is an open-source project that creates
a peer-to-peer overlay network that sits on top of TCP/IP. Ever
peer on the network is given an IP-address like number, even if they
are
behind a firewall or don't have a stable IP address. Super-peers
on the Jxta network run application-level routers which store special
information such as how to reach peers, how to join sub-groups of
peers,
and what content peers are making available. Jxta
application-level relays can proxy requests between peers that would
not
normally be able to communicate due to firewalls or NAT devices. Peers
organize themselves into Peer Groups, which scope all search
requests and act as natural security containers. Any peer can
publish and create a peer group in a decentralized way, and other peers
can search for and discover these peer groups using other super-peers.
Peers communicate using Pipes, which are very similar to Unix
pipes. Pipes abstract the exact way in which two peers
communicate, allowing peers to communicate using other peers as
intermediaries if they normally would not be able to communicate due to
network partitioning.<br>
<br>
Jxta is an extremely powerful framework. However, it is not an
easy framework to learn, and porting existing software to work on Jxta
is not for the faint-of-heart. P2P Sockets effectively hides Jxta
by creating a thin illusion that the peer-to-peer network is actually a
standard TCP/IP network. If a peer wishes to become a server
they simply create a P2P server socket with the domain name they want
and the port other peers should use to contact them. P2P clients
open socket connections to hosts that are running services on given
ports. Hosts can be resolved either by domain name, such as
"www.nike.laborpolicy", or by IP address, such as "44.22.33.22". Behind
the scenes these resolve to JXTA primitives rather than
being resolved through DNS or TCP/IP. For example, the host name
"www.nike.laborpolicy" is actually the NAME field of a Jxta Peer Group
Advertisement. P2P sockets and server sockets work exactly the
same as normal TCP/IP sockets and server sockets.<br>
<br>
The benefits of taking this approach are many-fold. First,
programmers can easily leverage their knowledge of standard TCP/IP
sockets and server sockets to work on the Jxta peer-to-peer network
without having to learn about Jxta. Second, all of the P2P Sockets
code subclasses standard java.net objects, such as java.net.Socket, so
existing network applications can quickly be ported to work on a
peer-to-peer network. The P2P Sockets project already includes a
large amount of software ported to use the peer-to-peer network,
including a web server (Jetty) that can receive requests and serve
content over the peer-to-peer network; a servlet and JSP engine (Jetty
and Jasper) that allows existing servlets and JSPs to serve P2P
clients;
an XML-RPC client and server (Apache XML-RPC) for accessing and
exposing
P2P XML-RPC endpoints; an HTTP/1.1 client (Apache Commons HTTP-Client)
that can access P2P web servers; a gateway (Smart Cache) to make it
possible for existing browsers to access P2P web sites; and a <a
 href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWiki">WikiWiki</a>
(JSPWiki)
that can be used to host WikiWikis on your local machine that other
peers can access and edit through the P2P network. Even better, all of
this software works and looks exactly as it did before being ported.
The P2P Sockets abstraction is so strong that porting each of
these pieces of software took as little as 30 minutes to several hours.
Everything included in the P2P sockets project is open-source,
mostly under BSD-type licenses, and cross-platform due to being written
in Java.<br>
<br>
Because P2P Sockets are based on Jxta, they can easily do things that
ordinary server sockets and sockets can't handle. First, creating
server sockets that can fail-over and scale is easy with P2P Sockets.
Many different peers can start server sockets for the same host
name and port, such as "www.nike.laborpolicy" on port 80. When a
client opens a P2P socket to "www.nike.laborpolicy" on port 80, they
will randomly connect to one of the machines that is hosting this port.
All of these server peers might be hosting the same web site, for
example, making it very easy to partition client requests across
different server peers or to recover from losing one server peer. This
is analagous to DNS round-robining, where one host name will
resolve to many different IP addresses to help with load-balancing.
Second, since P2P Sockets don't use the DNS system, host names can
be whatever you wish them to. You can create your own fanciful
endings, such as "www.boobah.cat" or "www.cynthia.goddess", or
application-specific host names, such as "Brad GNUberg" or "Fidget666"
for an instant messaging system. Third, the service ports for a
given host name can be distributed across many different peers around
the world. For example, imagine that you have a virtual host for
"www.nike.laborpolicy". One peer could be hosting port 80, to
serve web pages; another could be hosting port 2000, for instant
messaging, and a final peer could be hosting port 3000 for peers to
subscribe to real-time RSS updates. Hosts now become decentralized
coalitions of peers working together to serve requests.<br>
